                        <h3>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</h3>
                        <p>This syndrome occurs as a result of a combination of health conditions and activities that put pressure on the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist, and this pressure leads to the various symptoms. Gym activities like push-ups, plank pose, and other exercises that involve bending the wrist forward or backward excessively decreases the amount of space in the carpal tunnel, increases the amount of tissue in the tunnel, or increases the sensitivity of the median nerve. Repeated hand and wrist movements cause the membranes surrounding the tendons to swell. Even broken wrist bones, dislocated bones, or bone spurs take up space in the carpal tunnel, putting more pressure on the median nerve.<br>Treatment: The goal of the treatment is to allow the individuals to prevent nerve damage and loss of muscle strength in the fingers and hands, which will enable the individual to resume normal activities. Wear a wrist splint and avoid or change up the activities, especially the gym routines. Anti-inflammatory drugs, and in some cases, oral corticosteroids or injections are also prescribed. A carpal tunnel syndrome surgery is also recommended when other treatments fail, or if the condition persists for a long time, leading to nerve damage.<br>Avoidance Tactics: Avoid exercises like push-ups and planks that involve excessive bending of the wrist. Use hand and wrist movements that spread the pressure and motion evenly. Switch hands and positions often when doing repeated motions. Use correct posture, and reduce the salt intake that leads to fluid retention. Staying at a healthy weight and keeping the arm, hand, and finger muscles strong and flexible can help avoid this injury.</p>

                        <h3>Sternal Fracture</h3>
                        <p>The sternum is the bone that attaches the two clavicles on either side of the upper chest and the upper seven ribs. While doing the bench press, if the bar comes crashing down on the chest, the sternum bears the brunt of the impact. A direct fall on the chest can result in a bruised sternum, or if the impact is beyond what the bone can bear, a break in the sternum may occur. A sternum fracture may be associated with damage to other structures and organs of the body like the ribs, vertebrae, lungs, and blood vessels. The fracture causes sharp and intense chest pain which increases during breathing, coughing, laughing, or sneezing. This condition may also cause swelling and pain with certain movements such as pushing, pulling, or heavy lifting.<br>Treatment: Individuals with a sternum fracture should undergo a thorough medical examination to rule out damage to the heart, lungs, blood vessels, or any other organs. The treatment consists of rest from strenuous activities, along with pain-relieving medicines. Surgical intervention is required in cases of bone displacement to restore the bone alignment and to fix the bones using pins or plates. Icing the fractured area in the initial stage helps ease pain and swelling. Exercises that improve posture, strength, and flexibility will help prevent stiffness and weakness from developing.<br>Avoidance Tactics: It is important that individuals with a sternum fracture take rest from any heavy, strenuous activities that will increase the pain and aggravate the injury. Activities that place stress on the sternum, like lying face down and applying direct pressure to the chest, should be avoided. Even after the sternum has healed, there should be a gradual return to the gym routine under the guidance of the treating physiotherapist or surgeon. Use of protective padding or chest guards may be required when returning to gym workouts.</p>

                        <h3>Bicep Tendon Rupture</h3>
                        <p>The bicep muscle has two tendons; one that attaches to the shoulder, and one tendon that attaches at the elbow. The tendon at the elbow is called distal biceps tendon, and when one attempts to curl a weight that is too heavy or suddenly drops the bar or dumbbell, it risks a tear in the bicep tendon. It can either be a partial tear that damages the soft tissue, but does not completely sever the tendon, or a complete tear that detaches the tendon from its attachment point at the bone. The rupture is accompanied by intense pain and swelling in the front of the elbow. There is a visible bulge in the upper part of the arm created by the recoiled, shortened biceps muscle, and a gap in the front of the elbow due to the absence of the tendon.<br>Treatment: The doctor will conduct an examination of the elbow, testing the strength of the forearm. Non-surgical treatment includes anti-inflammatory medications to reduce pain and swelling, and using a sling to give the arm rest from any kind of activities. Once the pain subsides, rehabilitation exercises to strengthen the surrounding muscles to restore movement and flexibility are recommended. If surgery is required, a hand surgeon may recommend performing it within the first 2-3 weeks, as over time the tendon and biceps muscles begin to scar and shorten, and surgery might not be effective. The surgery aims to reattach the distal biceps tendon to the forearm bone.<br>Avoidance Tactics: Any kind of heavy lifting should be avoided to help speed up the healing process. After the arm has healed, and the pain has subsided, the individual should gradually ease back into physical activities, including exercising. As you ease back into your gym routine, work with a weight you can handle, and work with the help of a spotter.</p>

                        <h3>Pectoral Strain</h3>
                        <p>This condition is characterized by a partial or complete tearing of one or more of the pectoral muscles. The pectoral muscles are a group of two muscles at the front of the chest. During stretching or contraction of the pectorals, tension is placed on the muscles and tendons. When there is excessive tension due to repetitive movements or high force, one or more of the pectoral muscles can tear. Usually while attempting to perform dumbbell flys with a weight that is heavier than one is accustomed to lifting, it leads to a tear of the chest muscle. This injury results in losing control of the dumbbell or barbell while bench pressing. Individuals experience pain that is centered around the chest, and front of the shoulder or arm pit. Individuals also experience bruising, swelling, muscle spasm, and weakness.<br>Treatment: Resting from intense physical activities, and icing the strained pectoral muscle reduces inflammation and keeps the pain under control. Applying compression bandages to the chest and torso helps in further containing the swelling. Massages, dry needling, trigger point release, and electrotherapy helps to improve range of movement, pain, and function. Individuals with pectoral strain should indulge in pain-free flexibility and strengthening exercises to ensure optimal recovery. If the strain does not improve, it may require pharmaceutical intervention, corticosteroid injection, or even a surgery may be needed in case of a complete rupture of the major muscle.<br>Avoidance Tactics: Stretching the pectorals before working out loosens up the muscles, which helps prevent muscle strain. Once the pain and swelling has been taken care of, you need to gradually get back into your workout routine. Make sure to work only with a load that is within your control. If it wobbles or feels like it is going to drop, chances are it is too heavy. In such cases, use a spotter for heavy sets. Use protective taping to reduce the likelihood of injury.</p>

                        <h3>Joint Dislocations</h3>
                        <p>When a joint experiences an unexpected or unbalanced impact, dislocation occurs. It is a bone slipping out of a joint, and it can be any joint in the body, such as the knee, hip, ankle, or shoulder. Not paying attention to one’s form or loading the bar with too much weight can result in a dislocated hand, shoulder, elbow, or knee. The excess pressure on the ligaments forces the bone out of its normal position. The dislocated area swells up and looks bruised. The area becomes discolored and may also have a strange shape as a result of the dislocation. It also results in loss of motion, pain during movement, numbness, and tingling sensations.<br>Treatment: The choice of treatment depends on which joint has been dislocated. Resting the area from any exhausting activities, and icing it or using a compression wrap gives relief from pain and swelling. The doctor repositions the joint back into place, and advises to wear a sling, splint, or cast for few days. This prevents any movement of the dislocated joint, speeding up the healing process. A pain killer or a muscle relaxant may be prescribed to help deal with the pain. If the dislocation is not given timely treatment, it can cause damage to the ligaments, nerves, or blood vessels, and surgery might be required in such extreme cases.<br>Avoidance Tactics: Practicing safe behavior helps prevent joint dislocation. Wearing protective gear or clothing, removing rugs from the floor or replacing them with non-skid rugs can help protect from dislocations. Do not try to move a dislocated joint back into place, except by a trained medical professional, or else it can damage the joint and the surrounding ligaments, blood vessels, and nerves. Alternate exercises for any one muscle group from one workout to the next. Ensure that the weight is light enough, such that you are able to press or pull in a smooth, steady motion to complete the set.</p>
