                        <h3>Iliotibial Band Syndrome</h3>
                        <p>This is an overuse injury common among cyclists. This injury occurs when the ligament that runs along the outside of the thigh from the hip to the shin becomes tight and inflamed. Cycling causes a flare-up of this symptom due to incorrect cycling position or a saddle that is too tall. Pain is felt when bending and straightening the knee, and weakness is felt in hip abduction or moving the leg out sideways. Naturally wide or tight IT bands or poor foot bio-mechanics makes one more prone to this injury.<br>Treatment: Individuals with this syndrome need to give their body complete rest, as cycling with this syndrome will only make it worse. Icing the affected area during the injury alleviates pain and inflammation, and icing after exercise is a good way of ensuring the pain doesn’t return. Anti-inflammatory medicine like Ibuprofen provides relief from acute pain and swelling. Doing strengthening exercises to strengthen the tensor fasciae latae muscle and gluteus medius help reduce the friction on the IT band tendon at the knee. Sports massage by a professional therapist can help relax and loosen the tissues.<br>Avoidance Tactics: Bike set-up is the major key in avoiding this syndrome. Saddle height dictates knee position. The knee over-straightens if it is too high, or over bends if it is too low.  The seat height should be such that your torso is in an ideal position, and you are able to reach the bar without being bunched up. Over training or increasing the mileage too quickly should be avoided.</p>

                        <h3>Lower Back Pain</h3>
                        <p>Long hours in an aggressive riding position, and the repeated and prolonged position are the major causes of lower back pain from cycling. The flexed position while cycling helps maintain a good aerodynamic performance and generate the force to pedal, this causes cyclists to suffer from lower back pain. Excessive flexion in the lumbar region of the spine can lead to herniated lumbar discs, nerve entrapment, and sciatica. The spinal column inserts into the pelvic bone, which means having weak muscles can prevent cyclists from generating the power needed from the core for aggressive riding positions. Hence, the supporting muscles are forced to compensate for the weakness leading to lower back pain.<br>Treatment: Treatment for this depends on the individual’s history and the severity of the pain. Putting a stop to all activities, especially cycling, will give time for the injured tissue and the nerve roots to begin healing, which in turn will relieve the back pain. Heat and/or ice packs give relief from the nagging pain and reduces inflammation. There are also many over-the-counter and prescription medicines available that help with the pain. There are medications that help with inflammation which causes pain, and some treatments inhibit the transmission of pain signals from reaching the brain. Exercising to build strength and flexibility, usually under the guidance of a trained physical therapist, is an essential element of any treatment plan.<br>Avoidance Tactics: A proper bike set-up is the most crucial aspect to avoid over-reaching if the frame is too large, or a hunched posture if the frame is too small. Watch the posture as slumping makes it harder to support the weight. Also, be extremely careful of the posture when lifting heavy objects. Do not bend over from the waist. Bend and straighten from the knees. A good core-strengthening exercise should be part of a cyclist’s regimen that will help them maintain riding positions for longer periods, while increasing balance and power.</p>

                        <h3>Foot Numbness</h3>
                        <p>Quite common among the athletes, foot numbness is a loss of feeling in the feet. It is mainly caused due to ill-fitting cycling shoes squeezing the metatarsal heads and cleats placed too far forward causing increased pressure around the ball of the foot. Cycling technique involving low cadence and excessive hill riding also causes this occurrence in cyclists. Damage, blockage, infection, or compression of a nerve that travels to the foot causes the numbness. The main symptom of this injury is loss of sensation in the foot along with additional symptoms like prickling, pins-and-needles, and a tingling sensation.<br>Treatment: Treatment for foot numbness depends on an accurate diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause. Following a medically-supervised exercise routine can help with the numbness. Correctly fitting shoes will ensure proper flow of blood to the feet, thus preventing the numbness. Proper positioning of the cleats ensures the pressure is not focused on the balls of the feet. Gentle massage of the numb area and warming the feet will aid proper circulation, thus reducing the numbness. However, if numbness occurs frequently, you should consult a doctor to rule out any other underlying causes of pain.<br>Avoidance Tactics: Avoiding tight clothing and ill-fitting shoes while cycling will go a long way in preventing numbness. Ensure the cleats are properly positioned so that there isn’t excessive stress on the balls of the feet. Hill climbing involves excessive push phases of cycling, which increases the pressure on the feet, causing numbness. Hence, hill climbing should be tapered to alleviate the problem.</p>

                        <h3>Saddle Sores</h3>
                        <p>For majority of the cyclists out there, especially the ones competing in cycling competitions, saddle sore is a common occurrence.  It generally refers to problems occurring in the area where the cycling shorts’ chamois contacts the body due to friction from the saddle. A saddle sore is essentially a tender spot that is usually raised, pink, or red in the area that rubs against the saddle. For a lot of cyclists, the sore looks like a pimple or an ingrown hair. These sores can hurt really bad, which makes riding a very painful experience.<br>Treatment: Once you get saddle sores, the best remedy is to stay off the bike for few days. The delicate skin needs time to heal without being subjected to more friction and sweat. A cool bath with Epsom salts speeds up the healing process. Once the area has been cleaned, apply tea tree oil to the affected area using cotton swabs, followed by Vaseline. A few days off the bike should calm down the inflamed area, but if it keeps coming back, it is time to see a dermatologist to see if there is any underlying problem. Sometimes if the skin breaks, bacteria gets inside, which could infect the sore. In this case antibiotics might be prescribed.<br>Avoidance Tactics: The two keywords for prevention is to keep everything clean and dry. Keep the area clean by taking a cold shower and allowing the area to air out completely. Lowering the saddle prevents side-to-side motion of the pelvis, which can cause friction against the seat. Find saddle shorts that work for you, and always wear clean shorts. Increase the distance biked gradually, and also use chamois cream to reduce friction and ease the discomfort of the skin rubbing against the saddle.</p>
