                        <h3>Runner’s Knee</h3>
                        <p>This is one of the most common injuries for runners. Irritation of the cartilage under the kneecap causes 40% of running injuries. Runner’s knee happens when the kneecap is out of alignment. Over a period of time the cartilage under the kneecap wears down, which causes pain when climbing up or down the stairs, squatting, or sitting with the knees bent for a long time. The pain experienced underneath the kneecap is also known as patellofemoral knee syndrome, and the pain can get worse with an increase in the intensity of the pain.<br><strong>Treatment:</strong> As a short term remedy, people suffering with runner’s knee should hit the pause button on running to alleviate the pain. Putting an ice pack for 20-30 minutes in 3-4 hours interval for few days can help cut down the pain. Use patellar straps or an elastic bandage to give the knees extra support, and anti-inflammatory drugs like Advil, Aleve, and Motrin can take care of the pain and swelling. Individuals could also practice stretching and strengthening exercises for the hips, glutes, and quad muscles. Severe cases may need surgery to correct the position of the kneecap so that stress is distributed evenly.<br><strong>Avoidance Tactics:</strong> Avoid putting excess weight on the knee, and avoid kneeling or squatting repeatedly. Keep the knee in an elevated position when sitting or lying down. Switching up the surfaces you run on, using short strides, wearing the proper footwear, and striking the ground directly underneath can help avoid this injury.</p>

                        <h3>Shin Splints</h3>
                        <p>This injury is common in runners but is also found in people who participate in running sports or jumping. It is an umbrella term that indicates various ailments involving pain in the shin area. It is characterized by inflammation of the muscle which causes pain along the inner edge of the shinbone. But in the worst case scenario it can turn into a stress fracture along the tibia, causing searing pain with every stride. This injury is commonly found among new runners and at the start of high school track or cross-country season. If the muscles surrounding the shin are tight, it puts more stress on the entire area.<br><strong>Treatment:</strong> Doctors will take X-rays and bone scans to rule out any fracture. Icing the shin will help ease the pain. Painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs like Ibuprofen and Naproxen, or an aspirin also help relieve the pain and reduce swelling. Physical therapy is usually recommended to treat the issues in the legs and running mechanics that cause shin splints. In some rare, severe cases, surgery is needed to take care of the stress fracture that led to shin splints.<br><strong>Avoidance Tactics:</strong> A sudden spike in the intensity and frequency of workouts is one of the greatest causes of shin splints. So, the frequency and intensity of the exercise should be increased gradually and methodically. New runners’ lower legs aren’t strong enough, so they need to develop a firm base before increasing mileage or introducing speed work. Always do warm-ups like jumping jacks to get the blood flowing and the muscles warm and ready, and also stretch the leg muscles after the workout. Wear proper footwear with good support and padding. If you are getting back to running after this injury, you need to ease back into it gently.</p>

                        <h3>Achilles Tendinitis</h3>
                        <p>Inflammation of the large tendon that attaches the calf to the back of the heel, the Achilles tendon, is called Achilles Tendinitis. This injury is characterized by pain and stiffness at the back of the lower leg, just above the heel at the Achilles tendon. Tight calves put a lot of strain on the Achilles tendon, and hard training over a period of time leads to this injury. Wrong, poorly supported footwear, or a sudden increase in volume and intensity of training also puts a lot of stress on that area, causing the same effect more quickly. Individuals with this injury often complain of sharp pain and swelling close to the heel.<br><strong>Treatment:</strong> Individuals suffering from this injury should focus on strengthening the lower legs by doing exercises like calf raises, single-leg dead lifts, single-leg squats, and box jumps. Icing the area and taking aspirin or Ibuprofen helps with relieving the pain and decreasing the swelling. If done right, self-massage also aids in easing the pain. If the injury doesn’t respond to home-based treatment in two weeks, you need to consult a physical therapist or orthopedic surgeon. Surgery to scrape the scar tissue is employed as a last resort treatment.<br><strong>Avoidance Tactics:</strong> Pay good attention to the footwear used for running, as the wrong choice of footwear can aggravate the injury. A dramatic and gradual increase in training, and incorporating exercises that strengthen the calf muscles into the workout routine will reduce the risk of this injury. Pay close attention to the training intensity and frequency. Don’t do too much or too quickly. Avoid weight bearing exercises and hill work.</p>

                        <h3>Pulled Hamstring</h3>
                        <p>This is quite a common injury among athletes, including runners. The hamstring is a group of four muscles that run along the back of the thigh which allows the leg to bend at the knee. When one or more of those muscles get overloaded it leads to hamstring strain, and the muscles are also likely to tear. If the strain is mild, the pain might be just bearable. But in certain cases the pain could be unbearable, making it nearly impossible to walk or even stand. Individuals could also experience a snapping or popping feeling while exercising. They also experience tenderness around that region and pain in the back of the thigh and lower buttock while walking, bending over, or straightening the leg.<br><strong>Treatment:</strong> Ice the leg and use an elastic bandage around the leg to keep the swelling down. Anti-inflammatory drugs like Ibuprofen, Advil, Aleve, and Motrin give relief from pain and swelling. Ensure not to put any weight on the leg as much as possible, and keep the leg elevated while sitting or lying down. If the pain is severe, crutches may be recommended to ease the stress on the legs. You could also consult a physical therapist, who can recommend some strengthening exercises for the hamstring to protect against the strain. In cases of severe injury, surgery may be required to repair the muscles and reattach them.<br><strong>Avoidance Tactics:</strong> Do warm-up exercises before and after running. Increase the intensity and volume gradually and in a systematic manner. Incorporate strengthening exercises for the leg muscles, especially the hamstrings as a preventive measure. Stop exercising if you feel any kind of pain. While healing the strain, work the hamstring with a new activity that won’t aggravate the strain, as pushing too much before a full recovery could re-injure the hamstring, leading to permanent muscle dysfunction.</p>

                        <h3>Plantar Fasciitis</h3>
                        <p>Plantar Fasciitis is inflammation of the bottom of the feet, and one of the peskiest problems that runners encounter. This condition is characterized by a sharp, tight painful sensation at the base of the heel like stepping on a nail. The pain can vary from moderate to excruciating. Over-training, overuse, and wrong choice of footwear can lead to this injury. The tight and weakened muscles in the foot cause the heels to take on an excessive load. Repeated strain can cause tiny tears in the ligament, causing weakness, pain, and inflammation.<br><strong>Treatment:</strong> The treatment aims to relieve the pain and inflammation, heal the small tears in the ligament, and correct foot problems like excessive pronation, so that there is no stress on the plantar fascia ligament. Limit, and if possible, stop the daily activities causing heel pain, like running or walking on hard surfaces. Orthotics and shoes with good shock absorption and the right arch support for the feet help eliminate the symptoms in the short run. Rolling the foot on a golf ball, icing the injured area, and stretching and strengthening the calf muscles will help provide relief. Toe stretches, calf stretches, and towel stretches after getting up in the morning can help ease the pain.<br><strong>Avoidance Tactics:</strong> Maintain a healthy weight for your height. Make sure to wear supportive shoes with good arch support and heel cushioning. Wear supportive shoes as soon as you get out of bed. Avoid being barefoot for long periods of time as it puts stress on the feet. Also alternate running with other sports that don’t put stress on the heels.
