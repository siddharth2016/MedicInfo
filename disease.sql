(1, 'Anemia', 'The causes of anemia may be classified as impaired red blood cell (RBC) production, increased RBC destruction (hemolytic anemias), blood loss and fluid overload (hypervolemia). Several of these may interplay to cause anemia eventually. Indeed, the most common cause of anemia is blood loss, but this usually does not cause any lasting symptoms unless a relatively impaired RBC production develops, in turn most commonly byiron deficiency.', 'Anemia goes undetected in many people and symptoms can be minor. The symptoms can be related to an underlying cause or the anemia itself. Most commonly, people with anemia report feelings of weakness or tired, and sometimes poor concentration. They may also report shortness of breath on exertion. In very severe anemia, the body may compensate for the lack of oxygen-carrying capability of the blood by increasing cardiac output. The patient may have symptoms related to this, such as palpitations, angina (if pre-existing heart disease is present), intermittent claudication of the legs, and symptoms of heart failure. On examination, the signs exhibited may include pallor (pale skin, lining mucosa, conjunctiva and nail beds), but this is not a reliable sign. There may be signs of specific causes of anemia.', 'Treatment for anemia usually involves taking iron supplements and making changes to your diet. If the underlying cause of iron deficiency is loss of blood - other than from menstruation - the source of the bleeding must be located and stopped. This may involve surgery.'),
(2, 'Diarrhea', 'Diarrhea is a problem everyone is familiar with it is one of the most common reasons for people to seek medical advice - but it can range from being a mild, usually temporary condition, to one that can threaten life.\r\nMost cases of diarrhea are the symptom of an infection in the gastrointestinal tract.\r\nThe microbes causing gastrointestinal infection that leads to diarrhea include:\r\nBacteria\r\nViruses\r\nParasitic organisms.\r\nThe most commonly identified causes of acute diarrhea in the US are the bacteria Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli.\r\nThere are cases of chronic diarrhea that are labeled "functional" because they cannot be not explained by structural or biochemical abnormalities.\r\nIn the developed world, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common cause of functional diarrhea\r\n\r\n', 'Signs and symptoms associated with diarrhea may include:\r\nFrequent, loose, watery stools\r\nAbdominal cramps\r\nAbdominal pain\r\nFever\r\nBlood in the stool\r\nBloating\r\n', 'Take frequent, small sips of water or a re-hydration drink and small bites of salty crackers. Try to increase your fluid intake to at least 1 qt (1 L) per hour for 1 to 2 hours, or longer if you keep having large amounts of diarrhea.'),
(3, 'Lung Cancer', 'Lung cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells that start off in one or both lungs; usually in the cells that line the air passages. The abnormal cells do not develop into healthy lung tissue, they divide rapidly and form tumors.\r\nPrimary lung cancer originates in the lungs, while secondary lung cancer starts somewhere else in the body, metastasizes, and reaches the lungs. They are considered different types of cancers and are not treated in the same way.\r\nIf lung cancer spreads to distant organs, it may cause:\r\nBone pain (like pain in the back or hips).\r\nNervous system changes (such as headache, weakness or numbness of an arm or leg, dizziness, balance problems, or seizures), from cancer spread to the brain or spinal cord.\r\nYellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), from cancer spread to the liver.\r\nLumps near the surface of the body, due to cancer spreading to the skin or to lymph nodes (collections of immune system cells), such as those in the neck or above the collarbone.\r\n\r\n', 'The most common symptoms of lung cancer are:\r\nA cough that does not go away or gets worse.\r\nCoughing up blood or rust-colored sputum (spit or phlegm).\r\nChest pain that is often worse with deep breathing, coughing, or laughing.\r\nHoarseness.\r\nWeight loss and loss of appetite.\r\nShortness of breath.\r\nFeeling tired or weak.\r\nInfections such as bronchitis and pneumonia that don’t go away or keep coming back.\r\nNew onset of wheezing.\r\n', 'Treatment depends on the type of lung cancer you have. The treatment for non small cell lung cancer is different from the treatment for small cell lung cancer.\r\n\r\n			Small cell lung cancer is mostly treated with chemotherapy. Surgery is only suitable if there is no sign that the cancer has spread to the lymph glands in the centre of the chest (the mediastinal lymph glands). This is rare with small cell lung cancer. It has usually spread at the time of diagnosis. So chemotherapy is usually the main treatment. You may also have radiotherapy to treat this type of lung cancer.\r\n\r\n			Non small cell lung cancer can be treated with surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a combination of these, depending on the stage when the cancer is diagnosed. Some people with advanced lung cancer may have biological therapy.'),
(4, 'Coronary Artery Diseases', 'What Is Coronary Artery Disease?\r\nThe arteries, which start out smooth and elastic, get plaque on their inner walls, which can make them more rigid and narrowed. This restricts blood flow to your heart, which can then become starved of oxygen.\r\nThe plaque could rupture, leading to a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.\r\nRisk Factors:\r\nCoronary artery disease has a number of well determined risk factors. The most common risk factors include smoking, family history, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, lack of exercise, stress, and high blood lipids.Smoking is associated with about 36% of cases and obesity 20%.Lack of exercise has been linked to 7–12% of cases.Exposure to the herbicide Agent orange may increase risk.Both rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus are independent risk factors as well.', 'Sign and Symptoms:\r\nChest pain that occurs regularly with activity, after eating, or at other predictable times is termed stable angina and is associated with narrowing of the arteries of the heart.\r\nAngina that changes in intensity, character or frequency is termed unstable. Unstable angina may precede myocardial infarction. In adults who go to the emergency department with an unclear cause of pain, about 30% have pain due to coronary artery disease\r\n', 'Lower your blood pressure. Prevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack or stroke. Prevent or delay the need for a stent or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or surgery, such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Reduce your heart''s workload and relieve coronary heart disease symptoms.'),
(5, 'Adenovirus Infection', 'What causes an infection with Adenovirus 14 (Ad14)?\r\nUsually, an individual becomes infected with Ad14 through person-to-person exposure via droplets containing Ad14 expelled by an infected person who coughs or sneezes. When these droplets reach the eyes, nose, or mouth, the Ad14 virus can attach and infect cells. These infected sites allow the virus to proliferate in some patients, and the virus then may go on to infect other organ systems, especially the lungs. Ad14 also can be passed through direct hand-to-hand contact if an infected patient has not washed their hands after coughing or sneezing. Adenoviruses can survive for days on objects like doorknobs, hand rails, and other objects. If a non-infected person touches the contaminated item, they can pick up the virus and then transfer it to a site (mouth, nose, eyes) where the virus can infect cells and proliferate.\r\n', 'Signs and Symptoms:\r\nAdenovirus 14 (Ad14) is termed the killer cold virus because of the high incidence of hospitalizations and deaths attributed to the viral strain.\r\nAd14 viruses are passed person to person or picked up from items touched by infected people and then initially invade cells in the eye, nose, or mouth that subsequently allow further spread to other body organs.\r\nSymptoms and signs resemble those of a cold (cough, runny nose, mild fever) for about three to five days; the majority of people clear the disease, but up to about 40% may need hospitalization with severe symptoms of pneumonia, and shortness of breath; other organ related symptoms may develop such as eye, bladder, and GI problems.\r\n', 'There is currently no adenovirus vaccine available to the general public.\r\n			<br/>\r\n			You can protect yourself and others from adenoviruses and other respiratory illnesses by following a few simple steps:\r\n			<br/>\r\n			1. Wash your hands often with soap and water.<br/>\r\n			2. Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.<br/>\r\n			3. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.<br/>\r\n			4. Avoid close contact with people who are sick.<br/>\r\n			5. Stay home when you are sick.<br/>'),
(6, 'Arthritis', 'What Causes Arthritis?\r\nCartilage is a firm but flexible connective tissue in your joints. It protects the joints by absorbing the pressure and shock created when you move and put stress on them. A reduction in the normal amount of this cartilage tissue cause some forms of arthritis.\r\nNormal wear and tear causes OA, one of the most common forms of arthritis. An infection or injury to the joints can exacerbate this natural breakdown of cartilage tissue. Your risk of developing OA may be higher if you have a family history of the disease.\r\nAnother common form of arthritis, RA, is an autoimmune disorder. It occurs when your body’s immune system attacks the tissues of the body. These attacks affect the synovium, a soft tissue in your joints that produces a fluid that nourishes the cartilage and lubricates the joints.\r\nRA is a disease of the synovium that will invade and destroy a joint. It can eventually lead to the destruction of both bone and cartilage inside the joint.\r\nThe exact cause of the immune system’s attacks is unknown, but scientists have discovered genetic markers that increase your risk of developing RA tenfold.\r\n', 'Pain, which can vary in severity, is a common symptom in virtually all types of arthritis. Other symptoms include swelling, joint stiffness and aching around the joints. Arthritic disorders like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis can affect other organs in the body, leading to a variety of symptoms.Symptoms may include:\r\nInability to use the hand or walk.\r\nStiffness, which may be worse in the morning, or after use.\r\nMalaise and fatigue\r\nWeight loss\r\nPoor sleep\r\nMuscle aches and pains\r\nTenderness\r\nDifficulty moving the joint.\r\nIt is common in advanced arthritis for significant secondary changes to occur. For example, arthritic symptoms might make it difficult for a person to move around and/or exercise, which can lead to secondary effects, such as:\r\nMuscle weakness\r\nLoss of flexibility\r\nDecreased aerobic fitness\r\nThese changes, in addition to the primary symptoms, can have a huge impact on quality of life.\r\n', '			1. Lose Weight<br/>\r\n			2. Get More Exercise<br/>\r\n			3. Use Hot and Cold Therapy<br/>\r\n			4. Try Acupuncture<br/>\r\n			5. Use Meditation to Cope With Pain<br/>\r\n			6.

(7, 'Type-2 Diabetes', 'What Causes Diabetes?\r\nYour pancreas makes a hormone called insulin. It''s what lets your cells turn glucose from the food you eat into energy. People with type 2 diabetes make insulin, but their cells don''t use it as well as they should. Doctors call this insulin resistance.\r\nAt first, the pancreas makes more insulin to try to get glucose into the cells. But eventually it can''t keep up, and the sugar builds up in your blood instead.\r\nUsually a combination of things cause type 2 diabetes, including:\r\nGenes:Scientists have found different bits of DNA that affect how your body makes insulin.\r\nExtra weight:Being overweight or obese can cause insulin resistance, especially if you carry your extra pounds around the middle. Now type 2 diabetes affects kids and teens as well as adults, mainly because of childhood obesity.\r\n', 'The symptoms of type 2 diabetes can be so mild you don''t notice them. In fact, about 8 million people who have it don''t know it.\r\nBeing very thirsty\r\nPeeing a lot\r\nBlurry vision\r\nBeing irritable\r\nTingling or numbness in your hands or feet.\r\nFeeling worn out.\r\nWounds that don''t heal.\r\nYeast infections that keep coming back.\r\n', 'Of those people who don''t need diabetes medicine, some find that their diabetes does "reverse" with weight control, diabetes-healthy eating, and exercise. Their bodies are still able to make and use insulin, and their blood sugar levels go back to normal. Their diabetes is in remission.\r\n			The first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes is diet, weight control and physical activity. If your blood sugar (glucose) level remains high despite a trial of these lifestyle measures then tablets to reduce the blood glucose level are usually advised. Insulin injections are needed in some cases if the blood glucose level remains too high despite taking tablets. Treatments for other related problems may also be advised.'),
(8, 'Sleeping sickness', 'Causes\r\nSleeping sickness is caused by two germs (protozoa), Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Trypanosomoa brucei gambiense . The more severe form of the illness is caused by T. b. rhodesiense.\r\nTsetse flies carry the infection. When an infected fly bites you, the infection spreads through your blood.\r\nRisk factors include living in parts of Africa where the disease is found and being bitten by tsetse flies. The disease does not occur in the United States. But travelers who have visited or lived in Africa can have the infection.\r\n', 'General symptoms include:\r\nAnxiety\r\nDrowsiness during the day\r\nFever\r\nHeadache\r\nInsomnia at night\r\nMood changes\r\nSleepiness (may be uncontrollable)\r\nSweating\r\nSwollen lymph nodes all over the body.\r\nSwollen, red, painful nodule at site of fly bite.\r\nWeakness\r\n', 'The main approaches to controlling African trypanosomiasis are to reduce the reservoirs of infection and the presence of the tsetse fly. Screening of people at risk helps identify patients at an early stage. Diagnosis should be made as early as possible and before the advanced stage to avoid complicated, difficult and risky treatment procedures.'),
(9, 'Stroke', 'Causes\r\nA stroke occurs when the blood supply to your brain is interrupted or reduced. This deprives your brain of oxygen and nutrients, which can cause your brain cells to die.\r\nA stroke may be caused by a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or the leaking or bursting of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke). Some people may experience only a temporary disruption of blood flow to their brain (transient ischemic attack, or TIA).\r\n', 'Other symptoms you should know:\r\nSudden NUMBNESS or weakness of face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body.\r\nSudden CONFUSION, trouble speaking or understanding speech.\r\nSudden TROUBLE SEEING in one or both eyes.\r\nSudden TROUBLE WALKING, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination.\r\nSudden SEVERE HEADACHE with no known cause.\r\n', 'Your doctor will probably prescribe several medicines after you have had a stroke. Medicines to prevent blood clots are typically used, because blood clots can cause TIAs and strokes.\r\n			<br/>\r\n			The types of medicines that prevent clotting are:<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n			1. Anticoagulant medicines.<br/>\r\n			2. Antiplatelet medicines.<br/>\r\n			Cholesterol-lowering and blood-pressure-lowering medicines are also used to prevent TIAs and strokes.'),
(10, 'Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases', 'What are the risk factors and common causes of COPD?\r\nMost cases of COPD are caused by inhaling pollutants; that includes smoking (cigarettes, pipes, cigars, etc.), and second-hand smoke.\r\nFumes, chemicals and dust found in many work environments are contributing factors for many individuals who develop COPD.\r\nGenetics can also play a role in an individual’s development of COPD—even if the person has never smoked or has ever been exposed to strong lung irritants in the workplace.\r\n', 'What are the signs and symptoms of COPD?\r\nIncreased breathlessness\r\nFrequent coughing (with and without sputum)\r\nWheezing\r\nTightness in the chest\r\n', 'The best way to keep COPD from starting or from getting worse is to not smoke.\r\n\r\n			There are clear benefits to quitting, even after years of smoking.

(11, 'Fungal Eye Infections', 'Who gets fungal eye infections?\r\n\r\nFungal eye infections usually occur in association with the following:\r\n\r\nEye injury, particularly with plant matter (for example, thorns or sticks)\r\nEye surgery (most commonly, cataract surgery)\r\nChronic eye disease involving the surface of the eye\r\nWearing contact lenses\r\nExposure to contaminated medical products that come in contact with the eye\r\nFungal bloodstream infection (like candidemia)\r\nIn addition to the risk factors listed above, people who have diabetes, weakened immune system, or use corticosteroids may be more likely to develop fungal eye infections than people without these conditions.', 'Symptoms of Fungal Eye Infections\r\nIn people who have had exposures that put them at risk for fungal eye infections, the symptoms of a fungal eye infection can appear anywhere from several days to several weeks after the fungi enter the eye. The symptoms of a fungal eye infection are similar to the symptoms of other types of eye infections (such as those caused by bacteria) and can include:\r\n\r\nEye pain\r\nEye redness\r\nBlurred vision\r\nSensitivity to light\r\nExcessive tearing\r\nEye discharge\r\nIf you have any of these symptoms, call your eye doctor right away. If you wear contact lenses, remove them immediately. Fungal eye infections are very rare, but if they aren’t treated, they can become serious and result in permanent vision loss or blindness.', 'All types of fungal eye infections must be treated with prescription antifungal medication, usually for several weeks to months. Natamycin is a topical (meaning it’s given in the form of eye drops) antifungal medication that works well for fungal infections involving the outer layer of the eye, particularly those caused by fungi such as Aspergillus and Fusarium. However, infections that are deeper and more severe may require treatment with antifungal medication such as amphotericin B, fluconazole, or voriconazole. These medications can be given by mouth, through a vein, or injected directly into the eye.'),
(12, 'Avian Influenza', 'Avian Influenza A Virus Infections in Humans\r\n\r\nAlthough avian influenza A viruses usually do not infect humans, rare cases of human infection with these viruses have been reported. Infected birds shed avian influenza virus in their saliva, mucous and feces. Human infections with bird flu viruses can happen when enough virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled. This can happen when virus is in the air (in droplets or possibly dust) and a person breathes it in, or when a person touches something that has virus on it then touches their mouth, eyes or nose. Rare human infections with some avian viruses have occurred most often after unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with avian influenza viruses. However, some infections have been identified where direct contact was not known to have occurred. Illness in humans has ranged from mild to severe.', 'Signs and Symptoms of Avian Influenza A Virus Infections in Humans\r\n\r\nThe reported signs and symptoms of low pathogenic avian influenza* (LPAI) A virus infections in humans have ranged from conjunctivitis to influenza-like illness (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) to lower respiratory disease (pneumonia) requiring hospitalization. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A virus infections in people have been associated with a wide range of illness from conjunctivitis only, to influenza-like illness, to severe respiratory illness (e.g. shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, viral pneumonia, respiratory failure) with multi-organ disease, sometimes accompanied by nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting and sometimes neurologic changes (altered mental status, seizures).', 'Currently, the best way to prevent infection with avian influenza A viruses is to avoid sources of exposure whenever possible. Most human infections with avian influenza A viruses have occurred following direct close or prolonged contact with sick or dead infected poultry. Infected birds shed avian influenza virus in their saliva, mucous and feces. Human infections with bird flu viruses can happen when enough virus gets into a person''s eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled. This can happen when virus is in the air (in droplets or possibly dust) and a person breathes it in, or when a person touches something that has virus on it then touches their mouth, eyes or nose.'),
(13, 'Dengue', 'Dengue:\r\nWith more than one-third of the world’s population living in areas at risk for infection, dengue virus is a leading cause of illness and death in the tropics and subtropics. As many as 400 million people are infected yearly. Dengue is caused by any one of four related viruses transmitted by mosquitoes. There are not yet any vaccines to prevent infection with dengue virus and the most effective protective measures are those that avoid mosquito bites. When infected, early recognition and prompt supportive treatment can substantially lower the risk of medical complications and death.\r\n\r\nDengue has emerged as a worldwide problem only since the 1950s. Although dengue rarely occurs in the continental United States, it is endemic in Puerto Rico and in many popular tourist destinations in Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands.', 'The principal symptoms of dengue are:\r\n\r\nHigh fever and at least two of the following:\r\nSevere headache\r\nSevere eye pain (behind eyes)\r\nJoint pain\r\nMuscle and/or bone pain\r\nRash\r\nMild bleeding manifestation (e.g., nose or gum bleed, petechiae, or easy bruising)\r\nLow white cell count\r\n\r\nGenerally, younger children and those with their first dengue infection have a milder illness than older children and adults.\r\n\r\nWatch for warning signs as temperature declines 3 to 7 days after symptoms began.\r\nGo IMMEDIATELY to an emergency room or the closest health care provider if any of the following warning signs appear:\r\n\r\nSevere abdominal pain or persistent vomiting\r\nRed spots or patches on the skin\r\nBleeding from nose or gums\r\nVomiting blood\r\nBlack, tarry stools (feces, excrement)\r\nDrowsiness or irritability\r\nPale, cold, or clammy skin\r\nDifficulty breathing', 'Because dengue is caused by a virus, there is no specific medicine or antibiotic to treat it, the only treatment is to treat the symptoms. For typical dengue, the treatment is purely concerned with relief of the symptoms (symptomatic). Rest and fluid intake for adequate hydration is important.Supplementation with intravenous fluids may be necessary to prevent dehydration and significant concentration of the blood if the patient is unable to maintain oral intake. A platelet transfusion is indicated in rare cases if the platelet level drops significantly (below 20,000) or if there is significant bleeding. The presence of melena may indicate internal gastrointestinal bleeding requiring platelet and/or red blood cell transfusion.'),
(14, 'Venous Thromboembolism (Blood clots)', 'Complications of DVT\r\n\r\nThe most serious complication of DVT happens when a part of the clot breaks off and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs, causing a blockage called pulmonary embolism (PE). If the clot is small, and with appropriate treatment, people can recover from PE. However, there could be some damage to the lungs. If the clot is large, it can stop blood from reaching the lungs and is fatal.\r\n\r\nIn addition, nearly one-third of people who have a DVT will have long-term complications caused by the damage the clot does to the valves in the vein called post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). People with PTS have symptoms such as swelling, pain, discoloration, and in severe cases, scaling or ulcers in the affected part of the body. In some cases, the symptoms can be so severe that a person becomes disabled.\r\n\r\nFor some people, DVT and PE can become a chronic illness; about 30% of people who have had a DVT or PE are at risk for another episode.', 'Everybody should know the signs and symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis(DVT)/PE, their risk for DVT/PE, to talk to their health care provider about their risk, and to seek care immediately if they have any sign or symptom of DVT/PE.\r\n\r\nDVT\r\nAbout half of people with DVT have no symptoms at all. The following are the most common symptoms of DVT that occur in the affected part of the body:\r\n\r\nSwelling\r\nPain\r\nTenderness\r\nRedness of the skin\r\nIf you have any of these symptoms, you should see your doctor as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nPE\r\n\r\nYou can have a PE without any symptoms of a DVT.\r\n\r\nSigns and symptoms of PE can include:\r\n\r\nDifficulty breathing\r\nFaster than normal or irregular heart beat\r\nChest pain or discomfort, which usually worsens with a deep breath or coughing\r\nCoughing up blood\r\nVery low blood pressure, lightheadedness, or fainting\r\nIf you have any of these symptoms, you should seek medical help immediately.', 'Anticoagulant medicines prevent blood clots getting bigger. They can also help stop part of the blood clot breaking off and becoming lodged in another part of your bloodstream (an embolism).\r\nAlthough they''re often referred to as "blood-thinning" medicines, anticoagulants don''t actually thin the blood. They alter proteins within it, which prevents clots forming so easily.\r\nHeparin and warfarin are two types of anticoagulants that are used to treat DVT. Heparin is usually prescribed first because it works immediately to prevent further clotting. After this initial treatment, you may also need to take warfarin to prevent another blood clot forming.'),
(15, 'Lassa fever', 'Lassa fever is an acute viral illness that occurs in west Africa. The illness was discovered in 1969 when two missionary nurses died in Nigeria. The virus is named after the town in Nigeria where the first cases occurred. The virus, a member of the virus family Arenaviridae, is a single-stranded RNA virus and is zoonotic, or animal-borne.\r\n\r\nLassa fever is endemic in parts of west Africa including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria; however, other neighboring countries are also at risk, as the animal vector for Lassa virus, the "multimammate rat" (Mastomys natalensis) is distributed throughout the region. In 2009, the first case from Mali was reported in a traveler living in southern Mali; Ghana reported its first cases in late 2011. Isolated cases have also been reported in Côte d’Ivoire and Burkina Faso and there is serologic evidence of Lassa virus infection in Togo and Benin.', 'Signs and symptoms of Lassa fever typically occur 1-3 weeks after the patient comes into contact with the virus. For the majority of Lassa fever virus infections (approximately 80%), symptoms are mild and are undiagnosed. Mild symptoms include slight fever, general malaise and weakness, and headache. In 20% of infected individuals, however, disease may progress to more serious symptoms including hemorrhaging (in gums, eyes, or nose, as examples), respiratory distress, repeated vomiting, facial swelling, pain in the chest, back, and abdomen, and shock. Neurological problems have also been described, including hearing loss, tremors, and encephalitis. Death may occur within two weeks after symptom onset due to multi-organ failure.\r\n\r\nThe most common complication of Lassa fever is deafness. Various degrees of deafness occur in approximately one-third of infections, and in many cases hearing loss is permanent. As far as is known, severity of the disease does not affect this complication: deafness may develop in mild as well as in severe cases.', 'Ribavirin, an antiviral drug, has been used with success in Lassa fever patients. It has been shown to be most effective when given early in the course of the illness. Patients should also receive supportive care consisting of maintenance of appropriate fluid and electrolyte balance, oxygenation and blood pressure, as well as treatment of any other complicating infections.'),
(16, 'Lead Poisoning', 'Today at least 4 million households have children living in them that are being exposed to high levels of lead. There are approximately half a million U.S. children ages 1-5 with blood lead levels above 5 micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL), the reference level at which CDC recommends public health actions be initiated.\r\n\r\nNo safe blood lead level in children has been identified. Lead exposure can affect nearly every system in the body. Because lead exposure often occurs with no obvious symptoms, it frequently goes unrecognized. ', 'What can be done to prevent exposure to lead?\r\nIt is important to determine the construction year of the house or the dwelling where your child spends a large amount of time (e.g., grandparents or daycare). In housing built before 1978, assume that the paint has lead unless tests show otherwise.\r\n\r\nTalk to your state or local health department about testing paint and dust from your home for lead.\r\n\r\nMake sure your child does not have access to peeling paint or chewable surfaces painted with lead-based paint.\r\n\r\nChildren and pregnant women should not be present in housing built before 1978 that is undergoing renovation. They should not participate in activities that disturb old paint or in cleaning up paint debris after work is completed.\r\n\r\nCreate barriers between living/play areas and lead sources. Until environmental clean-up is completed, you should clean and isolate all sources of lead. Close and lock doors to keep children away from chipping or peeling paint on walls. You can also apply temporary barriers such as contact paper or duct tape, to cover holes in walls or to block children’s access to other sources of lead.\r\n\r\nRegularly wash children’s hands and toys. Hands and toys can become contaminated from household dust or exterior soil. Both are known lead sources.\r\n\r\nRegularly wet-mop floors and wet-wipe window components. Because household dust is a major source of lead, you should wet-mop floors and wet-wipe horizontal surfaces every 2-3 weeks. Windowsills and wells can contain high levels of leaded dust. They should be kept clean. If feasible, windows should be shut to prevent abrasion of painted surfaces or opened from the top sash. Take off shoes when entering the house to prevent bringing lead-contaminated soil in from outside.\r\n\r\nPrevent children from playing in bare soil; if possible, provide them with sandboxes. Plant grass on areas of bare soil or cover the soil with grass seed, mulch, or wood chips, if possible. Until the bare soil is covered, move play areas away from bare soil and away from the sides of the house. If you have a sandbox, cover the box when not in use to prevent cats from using it as a litter box. That will help protect children from exposure to animal waste.', 'The first step in treating all degrees of lead poisoning is to remove the source of the contamination. If you can''t remove lead from your environment, you may at least be able to reduce the likelihood that it will cause problems. For instance, sometimes it''s better to seal in rather than remove old lead paint. Your local health department can recommend ways to identify and reduce lead in your home and community.\r\n<br/>\r\nFor children and adults with relatively low lead levels, simply avoiding exposure to lead may be enough to reduce blood lead levels.'),

Each year, 1 in 6 Americans gets sick by consuming contaminated foods or beverages. Many different disease-causing microbes, or pathogens, can contaminate foods, so there are many different foodborne infections. In addition, poisonous chemicals, or other harmful substances can cause foodborne diseases if they are present in food.\r\n\r\nFoods Associated with Foodborne Illness:\r\nRaw foods of animal origin, that is, raw meat and poultry, raw eggs, unpasteurized milk, and raw shellfish are the most likely to be contaminated. \r\n\r\nFruits and vegetables can also be contaminated with animal waste when manure is used to fertilize produce in the field, or unclean water is used for washing the produce. \r\n\r\nRaw sprouts are particularly concerning because the conditions under which they are sprouted are ideal for growing microbes. \r\n\r\nUnpasteurized fruit juices or cider can also be contaminated if there are pathogens on the fruit that is used to make it.\r\n\r\nAny food item that is touched by a person who is ill with vomiting or diarrhea, or who has recently had such an illness, can become contaminated. When these food items are not subsequently cooked (e.g., salads, cut fruit) they can pass the illness to other people.', 'Symptoms of Foodborne Illness\r\nCommon symptoms of foodborne illness are diarrhea and/or vomiting, typically lasting 1 to 7 days. Other symptoms might include abdominal cramps, nausea, fever, joint/back aches, and fatigue.\r\n\r\nWhat some people call the “stomach flu” may actually be a foodborne illness caused by a pathogen (i.e., virus, bacteria, or parasite) in contaminated food or drink. \r\n\r\nThe incubation period (the time between exposure to the pathogen and onset of symptoms) can range from several hours to 1 week.', 'The only treatment needed for most foodborne illnesses is replacing lost fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration. Over-the-counter medications such as loperamide (Imodium) and bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol and Kaopectate) may help stop diarrhea in adults.'),
(18, 'Typhoid Fever', 'General Information:\r\nTyphoid fever is a life-threatening illness caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi. An estimated 5,700 cases occur each year in the United States.  Most cases (up to 75%) are acquired while traveling internationally. Typhoid fever is still common in the developing world, where it affects about 21.5 million people each year.\r\n\r\nTyphoid fever can be prevented and can usually be treated with antibiotics. If you are planning to travel outside the United States, you should know about typhoid fever and what steps you can take to protect yourself.', 'What are the signs and symptoms of typhoid fever?\r\n\r\nPersons with typhoid fever usually have a sustained fever as high as 103° to 104° F (39° to 40° C). They may also feel weak, or have stomach pains, headache, or loss of appetite. In some cases, patients have a rash of flat, rose-colored spots. The only way to know for sure if an illness is typhoid fever is to have samples of stool or blood tested for the presence of Salmonella Typhi.', 'Typhoid fever is treated with antibiotics that kill the Salmonella bacteria. Prior to the use of antibiotics, the fatality rate was 20%. Death occurred from overwhelming infection, pneumonia, intestinal bleeding, or intestinal perforation. With antibiotics and supportive care, mortality has been reduced to 1%-2%.\r\n<br/>\r\nMake sure you rest, drink plenty of fluids and eat regular meals. You may find it easier to eat smaller meals more frequently, rather than three larger meals a day.\r\nYou should also maintain good standards of personal hygiene, such as regularly washing your hands with soap and warm water, to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others.'),
(19, ' Influenza flu', 'How Flu Spreads\r\nPerson to Person\r\n\r\nPeople with flu can spread it to others up to about 6 feet away. Most experts think that flu viruses are spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Less often, a person might also get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth or nose.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, people should stay away from sick people and stay home if sick. It also is important to wash hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub. Linens, eating utensils, and dishes belonging to those who are sick should not be shared without washing thoroughly first. Eating utensils can be washed either in a dishwasher or by hand with water and soap and do not need to be cleaned separately. Further, frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected at home, work and school, especially if someone is ill.\r\n\r\nThe Flu Is Contagious\r\n\r\nMost healthy adults may be able to infect other people beginning 1 day before symptoms develop and up to 5 to 7 days after becoming sick. Children may pass the virus for longer than 7 days. Symptoms start 1 to 4 days after the virus enters the body. That means that you may be able to pass on the flu to someone else before you know you are sick, as well as while you are sick. Some people can be infected with the flu virus but have no symptoms. During this time, those persons may still spread the virus to others.', 'Influenza Symptoms\r\n\r\nInfluenza (also known as the flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by flu viruses. It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. The flu is different from a cold. The flu usually comes on suddenly. People who have the flu often feel some or all of these symptoms:\r\n\r\nFever* or feeling feverish/chills\r\nCough\r\nSore throat\r\nRunny or stuffy nose\r\nMuscle or body aches\r\nHeadaches\r\nFatigue (tiredness)\r\nSome people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults.\r\n* It''s important to note that not everyone with flu will have a fever.', 'Usually, you''ll need nothing more than bed rest and plenty of fluids to treat the flu. But in some cases, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medication, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza). If taken soon after you notice symptoms, these drugs may shorten your illness by a day or so and help prevent serious complications.\r\n\r\nOseltamivir is an oral medication. Zanamivir is inhaled through a device similar to an asthma inhaler and shouldn''t be used by anyone with respiratory problems, such as asthma and lung disease.'),
(20, 'Tuberculosis(TB)', 'How TB Spreads\r\nTB bacteria are spread through the air from one person to another. The TB bacteria are put into the air when a person with TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, speaks, or sings. People nearby may breathe in these bacteria and become infected.\r\n\r\nTB is NOT spread by\r\n\r\nshaking someone''s hand\r\nsharing food or drink\r\ntouching bed linens or toilet seats\r\nsharing toothbrushes\r\nkissing\r\nWhen a person breathes in TB bacteria, the bacteria can settle in the lungs and begin to grow. From there, they can move through the blood to other parts of the body, such as the kidney, spine, and brain.\r\n\r\nTB disease in the lungs or throat can be infectious. This means that the bacteria can be spread to other people. TB in other parts of the body, such as the kidney or spine, is usually not infectious.\r\n\r\nPeople with TB disease are most likely to spread it to people they spend time with every day. This includes family members, friends, and coworkers or schoolmates.', 'Symptoms of TB disease depend on where in the body the TB bacteria are growing. TB bacteria usually grow in the lungs (pulmonary TB). TB disease in the lungs may cause symptoms such as\r\n\r\na bad cough that lasts 3 weeks or longer\r\npain in the chest\r\ncoughing up blood or sputum (phlegm from deep inside the lungs)\r\nOther symptoms of TB disease are\r\n\r\nweakness or fatigue\r\nweight loss\r\nno appetite\r\nchills\r\nfever\r\nsweating at night\r\nSymptoms of TB disease in other parts of the body depend on the area affected.\r\n\r\nPeople who have latent TB infection do not feel sick, do not have any symptoms, and cannot spread TB to others', 'If you have active TB disease, your doctor will give you several antibiotics to treat the infection and to help prevent resistant bacteria from emerging in your body. You may be taking a combination of antibiotics that may include isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, or ethambutol for 6 to 12 months.');
