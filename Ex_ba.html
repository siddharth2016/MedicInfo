                        <h3>Muscle Spasms</h3>
                        <p>When a muscle is overstretched or torn, inflammation occurs, which results in muscle spasms. Spasms can affect different types of muscles, exhibiting different symptoms. Muscle spasms occur due to overuse, dehydration, or electrolyte abnormalities, or if the muscle has been held in the same position for a prolonged period of time. A dance workout involves muscular effort that can overstretch or tear the muscle, causing sustained and involuntary contraction. Muscle spasm symptoms include an acute onset of pain, along with a severe decrease in the efficiency of the muscular group that is affected. A bulging, tight muscle may be felt underneath the skin.<br>Treatment: Most muscle spasm   cases resolve within a couple of days or weeks. Rest and regulation of the dance workouts help treat the condition. Wet heat or deep heat like ultrasound or short waves, professional massage, and soft mechanical stretching are also some of the treatment options to treat muscle spasms. There is a circular behavior in spasms, in which the contraction causes pain, and the pain leads to further contraction. So painkillers are prescribed to eliminate the pain and to break the circle and release the muscular fibers.<br>Avoidance Tactics: Most of the muscle spasms are associated with dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. So, it is essential to keep hydrated during the dance routines. If the dance workout is taking place in a hot environment, it is important to fuel the body with enough fluids prior to the workout.</p>

                        <h3>Snapping Hip Syndrome</h3>
                        <p>A snapping hip syndrome is also known as dancer’s hip, in which one hears a snapping sound or feels a snapping sensation in the hip while walking, running, or swinging the leg around. Snapping is caused by the movement of a muscle or tendon over a bony structure in the hip. For most people the only symptom is the snapping sound or the sensation, but for dancers and athletes, this syndrome is also accompanied by pain and weakness that interfere with their performance. Iliotibial (IT) band tightness, weakness along the outside of the hip and lordosis are some of the causes of this syndrome. Dancers could experience a snapping sound in the frontal hip joint, as the IT band glides over the upper-leg bone.<br>Treatment: In most cases, the snapping hip syndrome can be treated with home remedies. Icing the area  reduces swelling, while over-the-counter pain medications are used to relieve the snapping pain.  Corticosteroid injections to the affected area are prescribed to reduce the inflammation. Reducing or modifying the activity is recommended to help in the healing process. Physical therapy is an effective treatment method, with emphasis on stretching, strengthening, and alignment. Surgery is recommended in very rare cases if the condition doesn’t improve.<br>Avoidance Tactics: Strengthening the lower abs, abductors, adductors, and hip flexors help prevent this syndrome. So, once the symptoms have stabilized, a maintenance program involving stretching and strengthening is initiated. Light warm-up exercises should be done before a dance workout, which warms and preps the muscles for the activity. Dancers should avoid turning out the feet, which causes stress to the knees and hips.</p>

                        <h3>Meniscus Tear</h3>
                        <p>Dancers commonly suffer from meniscus tears. The medial and lateral menisci are two large C-shaped cartilages within the knee joint that protects the joint from the stresses placed on it from walking, running, climbing, and bending. A tear in the meniscus occurs because of forceful twisting or hyper-flexing of the knee joint. A quick turn or twist, often with the foot planted while the knee is bent, like in many dance forms, causes a torn meniscus. It can also occur while playing sports. Its symptoms include knee pain, swelling, popping, and giving way.<br>Treatment: The doctor conducts a physical examination, checking both the knees, looking for tenderness, range of motion, and the stability of the knee. The treatment procedure for a torn meniscus depends on various factors like the type of tear, location of the tear, and how serious it is. Resting the knee, icing the affected area, wrapping it with an elastic bandage to give it a break from any kind of movement, and propping up the legs are some of the treatment procedures used to heal the tear. If the conservative measures fail, surgery may be needed to repair or remove the damaged cartilage.<br>Avoidance Tactics: It is recommended to maintain an ideal body weight that helps avoid such tears from occurring. Specific recommendations regarding weight-bearing are suggested by the surgeon and therapist to prevent the painful meniscus tear. Activities that put a lot of stress on the knee should be avoided. There should be a gradual return to dancing activities to prevent a recurrence of the tear.</p>

                        <h3>Ankle Sprain</h3>
                        <p>Even though it is quite a common injury, it is by no means a minor injury. A rapid shifting movement with the foot planted, like in dancing, or even in soccer or getting tackled in football, causes the sprain. In a sprain, the ankle rolls outward, while the foot turns inward, which causes ligaments of the ankle to stretch and tear. In some cases the ankle rolls inward and the foot outward, damaging the ligaments inside the ankle. An ankle sprain ranges from mild to severe. It depends on how many ligaments are injured and how badly they are injured. The common symptoms are pain, tenderness, and swelling. In case of severe sprains, a tear is experienced along with a pop or snap.<br>Treatment: The sprained ankle needs rest for complete healing. Icing the area frequently gives relief from swelling. An elastic compression wrap also reduces swelling, but as compression wraps don’t offer protection, a brace might be needed if any weight is being put on it. The ankle should be elevated above the level of the heart for two to three hours a day. Either prescription painkillers or over-the-counter pain relievers are used to relieve the pain. If the sprain doesn’t heal correctly, the joint may become unstable and turn into chronic pain. In rare cases, arthroscopy or reconstruction surgery is performed to repair the torn ligament.<br>Avoidance Tactics: The risk of an ankle sprain can be avoided by warming up before a dance workout, and using proper footwear. Wearing a brace gives it added support, thus avoiding the occurrence of a sprain. Stretching, strength training, and balance exercises keep the ankle strong and flexible, preventing further injury.</p>

                        <h3>Neck strain</h3>
                        <p>Dancing and choreography which incorporates a lot of head movements causes a strain on the dancers’ neck muscles. The cervical spine provides support for the head, and allows mobility and range of motions, but it also makes this area of the spine so flexible that it becomes vulnerable to injury. If dancers do not use the full spine properly when arching the head or neck, it causes strain to the neck muscles. A neck strain is usually characterized by dull aching pain, numbness, tingling, tenderness, and difficulty swallowing. Individuals can sometimes also experience a sharp pain, dizziness, and swelling in the lymph nodes.<br>Treatment: The treatment of a neck strain is based on the precise cause of the injury. For moderate pain, bed rest is advised. A cervical collar or putting a pillow to support the neck helps with the discomfort. The cold from an ice pack reduces the inflammation, and applying heat brings nutrient-rich blood flow to the injured area, stimulating a healing response. Anti-inflammatory medications, or pain relievers are used to get relief from the pain. In many cases, a gentle massage helps stimulate the blood flow in the area.<br>Avoidance Tactics: Individuals should avoid stretching the neck beyond their normal limit to prevent stress on the neck muscles. For dance moves requiring a lot of head movements, try to lengthen the neck rather than collapsing it. Avoid any additional strain to the neck, so that the symptoms subside quickly. Make sure to warm up before the dance routine, so that the muscles are strengthened and flexible enough for the workout.</p>
